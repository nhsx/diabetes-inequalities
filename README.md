## Installation
Installation is possible via `pip` as shown below.

Unix/macOS
```bash
python3 -m pip install esneft_tools
```

Windows
```bash
py -m pip install esneft_tools
```

#### Install within a Virtual Environment (optional)
<details>
<summary><strong>Unix/macOS</strong></summary>

```bash
python -m venv esneft_tools
source esneft_tools/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install esneft_tools
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows</strong></summary>

```bash
py -m venv esneft_tools
esneft_tools/Scripts/Activate.ps1
py -m pip install esneft_tools
```

If running scripts is disabled on your system then run the following command before activating your environment.

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
</details>


#### Geospatial Dependencies (optional)
Additional geospatial utilities may be optionally installed as below.
Note these packages have non-trivial dependencies and automatic installation may not work on all systems.

An additional optional dependency, OSMnx, must be installed by the user.
Please refer to the [OSMnx documentation](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for further installation instructions.

<details>
<summary><strong>Clear here for code</strong></summary>

Unix/macOS
```bash
python3 -m pip install esneft_tools[geo]
```

Windows
```bash
py -m pip install esneft_tools[geo]
```

</details>


## Setup
The logging level of `esneft_tools` can be set via the `setVerbosity()` function.

```python
import logging
from esneft_tools.utils import setVerbosity
from esneft_tools import download, process, visualise

setVerbosity(logging.INFO)
```

## Retrieve Public Data

### Download

#### From Host
Each of the `esneft_tools.download.getData().fromHost()` functions retrieve a static copy of a particular data set from GitHub.
A local copy of these tables is saved to `./.data-cache/` by default.
Each can be obtained individually but it is recommended to retrieve all data, as below.

```python
# Instantiate data download class.
getData = download.getData(cache='./.data-cache')

# Retrieve all data as dictionary (recommended)
data = getData.fromHost('all')
```

* `all` **(default)**
  * Retrieve all of the below data in dictionary format (**recommended**).
*  `postcodeLSOA`
  * Postcode -> LSOA (2011) lookup Table from [ArcGIS](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/ons::national-statistics-postcode-lookup-2021-census-november-2022/about)
*  `imdLSOA`
  * Indices of Deprivation by LSOA in England from [National Statistics (.gov.uk)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/845345/File_7_-_All_IoD2019_Scores__Ranks__Deciles_and_Population_Denominators_3.csv/preview)
*  `populationLSOA`
  * LSOA population estimates, by age and sex, from [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/lowersuperoutputareamidyearpopulationestimates)
* `ethnicityLSOA`
  * Proportion of ethnicity minorities (non-white) by LSOA from [NOMIS](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/select/getdatasetbytheme.asp?opt=3&theme=&subgrp=)
*  `areaLSOA`
  * Land hectare measures by LSOA from [ArcGIS](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/ons::standard-area-measurements-latest-for-2021-statistical-geographies-in-england-and-wales-v2-1/about)
* `gpRegistration`
  * GP registration by LSOA [NHS Digital](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/patients-registered-at-a-gp-practice/metadata)
* `gpPractice`

* `gpStaff`
  * GPs by GP Practices from [NHS Digital](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/organisation-data-service/file-downloads/gp-and-gp-practice-related-data)
* `qof`
  * Quality and Outcomes Framework, 2021-22 from [NHS Digital](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/quality-and-outcomes-framework-achievement-prevalence-and-exceptions-data/2021-22)
* `geoLSOA`
  * LSOA GeoJSON from [UK Data Service](https://statistics.ukdataservice.ac.uk/dataset/2011-census-geography-boundaries-lower-layer-super-output-areas-and-data-zones)
* `esneftLSOA`
  * List of LSOAs within ESNEFT trust.
* `esneftOSM`
  * OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for ESNEFT area from [Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/great-britain/england.html)

#### From Source
Alternatively, the `.fromSource()` method can be used to retrieve each dataset directly from its public source.
By default, `esneft_tools` will retrieve the source data that matches the `fromHost()` methods.
Each source URL can be updated to newer versions by providing a YAML file to `download.getData()` as shown below.
An example of the YAML file is shown [here](./README_files/sourceURL.yaml).

<details>
<summary><strong>Clear here for code</strong></summary>

```python
# Instantiate data download class.
getData = download.getData(sourceURL='sourceURL.yaml', cache='./.data-cache')

# Retrieve a specific dataset from host.
# Note: "all" does not work with .fromSource().
imdLSOA = getData.fromSource('imdLSOA')
```

</details>

### Processing

#### Aggregate by Practice Level
The `getGPsummary` function aggregates the downloaded data to practice level statistics.

```python
GPsummary = process.getGPsummary(**data, iod_cols='IMD')
```
